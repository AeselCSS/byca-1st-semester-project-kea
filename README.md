# cyba-1st-semester-project-kea

Semesterproject for the first semester at KEA. The project is a small CRUD application with focus on the frontend, and with Firebase as BaaS. The project is based on a case of a swimming club that is in need of a system to manage their members.

Created as part of our AP Graduate in Computer Science Program at KEA.

## Usage
Usernames and passwords will be send to the teachers via Fronter, as they are not included in the repository.
